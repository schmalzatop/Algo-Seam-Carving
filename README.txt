TO RUN:

Complie: g++ main.cpp
Execute: ./a.out 'image' 'vertical seams' 'horizontal seams' 'S'

Reasonsing of 'S' this is initate the shrink function for the project. 
Different letters were setup to use for the bonus that I played to 
complete but way out of time to finish. So letters 'E' for enlarge
or 'R' for remove will give an output of feature coming soon. 

Unique/Notable:
My project creates a custom class image to hold the .pgm image
in a 2d array. My project also does not rotate the image but
carves seams vertically and horizontally, with horizontal 
behaving as if the image was rotated.
